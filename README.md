## 🧠 About Me

I spent the last few years at a fast-scaling fintech during its rocket ride from Series A to Series C — growing from a 60-person startup to a 1500-strong company across multiple tech hubs. Along the way, I worked on transaction monitoring, payment screening, and revenue features, while integrating tools like Unit21, Xero, and Kustomer to supercharge internal workflows.

I led key initiatives to reduce operational overhead, helped analysts work smarter, and quietly became the go-to for complex third-party API work. I also helped onboard new engineers and nudged us all toward cleaner code and tighter feedback loops.

Before that? I’ve done a bit of everything — from building chatbots and trading platforms to scaling betting systems and automating all the things.


I ❤️:
- Automating boring stuff (Make, Zapier, Retool? Yes please)
- Tinkering with APIs and stitching weird systems together  
- Building tools that save teams time and headaches  
- Open source, weird AI side quests, and mentoring

I’ve also built bots (like, actual chatbots), workflow tools, and a few explosions in Node.js.
